# Regression-Analysis-of-Nanoporous-Silicon-Carbide
This is data that I compiled myself while I was doing research for Dr. Blair Tuttle at Penn State Behrend and while I was in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program under Dr. Sokrates Pantelides at Vanderbilt University.

Each row in the read-in Excel sheet represents one theoretical model of silicon carbide that has been altered to be nanoporous, with any dangling bonds being satisfied by placing a hydrogen atom at that location. Each model was relaxed with Density Functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with a plane wave cutoff of 400 eV. This is esentially a way to solve the Schrödinger equation numerically. By solving the Schrödinger equation, we gain all sorts of insights about the electronic properties of compounds--in this case hydrogenated nanoporous silicon carbide. This data was either extracted or derived from the output of the VASP program.
